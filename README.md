src/
    This is where your React application's source code resides. It includes your React components, hooks, utilities, services, and so on.
    components/: This folder contains all the shared React components like buttons, modals, inputs, etc. Each component can have its own folder with its associated files (like CSS or tests).
    pages/ or views/: Contains components that represent entire pages of your application. This helps in organizing your components based on routes.
    hooks/: If you're using custom hooks, they can be placed here. This helps in reusing logic across components.
    context/: If you're using React's Context API for state management, you can place your context files here.
    services/: For any external service or API integrations.
    assets/: Static files like images, fonts, and icons.
    styles/: Global stylesheets or style-related utilities.
    utils/: Utility/helper functions that can be used across your application.
    App.js: The main React component that serves as the entry point for rendering the component tree.
    index.js: The JavaScript entry point, where you render the App component to the DOM.

public/
    Contains assets that are not imported into your JS files but need to be part of your build, like index.html, favicon, etc.

Optional:
    .env files: For environment variables.
    tests/: If you have a significant number of tests, you might want to organize them into their own directory.
    config/: For more complex setups, you might have additional configuration files.
